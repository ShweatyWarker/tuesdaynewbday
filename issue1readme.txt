📖 ABOUT THIS REPO  
------------------------------------------------------------  
This repository is a personal learning sandbox 🌱  
I'm diving deep into the world of coding, Git, and version  
control, using this space to document my growth and  
progress along the way.

This isn't a final product — it's a **live journal** of my  
development process. Expect plenty of updates, commits,  
experiments, and revisions!
